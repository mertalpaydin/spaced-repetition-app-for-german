# TODO

Open work only. Closed work is in `docs/audits/fix-log.md` with its reasoning
and measurements; git history has the same in commit bodies.

Rule for anyone adding here, human or agent: **an item is a thing that is not
done.** When you close one, delete it and put the writeup in the fix log. This
file was allowed to reach 1,772 lines of finished work and was useless as a
work list. Do not do that again.

## 1. Known limits, recorded rather than solved

Not tasks. Do not "fix" these without a decision from the owner.

- **`Strässchen` and Swiss orthography with `ä`.** Standard German is
  `Sträßchen`. The rule added for Swiss spelling covers diphthongs before
  `ss` plus a closed list, and cannot decide `ä`: Swiss in `Strässchen` (long
  vowel), standard in `Fässer`, `Pässe`, `Gässchen` (short vowel). German
  orthography does not mark vowel length reliably enough. Recommendation
  already given and accepted: report it in each audit rather than pretend a
  rule exists.

- **Free datives and adjective-governed datives are out of reach of the verb
  government lexicon.** `Ich wasche mir die Hände` and `Meiner Schwester ist
  es kalt` have no governing verb to look up. They stay dropped.

- **`ausweichen` has no usable corpus evidence** and so is absent from the
  lexicon. A real coverage gap, not a threshold artefact.

- **Anything the verifier catches twice becomes a deterministic rule.** A
  standing rule, not a task. The verifier is a discovery instrument and must
  never be the only thing between a known defect class and a learner.

## 2. Open work

- [ ] **2.1 Re-run the corpus pilot and audit it.** Confirms the section 8
  fixes against a fresh sample. Command is in the session; outputs are
  `data/corpus_pilot_review.jsonl`, `_rejected.jsonl` and `_report.json`.

- [ ] **2.2 Get real numbers out of `scripts/eval_verifier.py`.** The
  adversarial set (38 confirmed defects, 31 confirmed clean) and the script
  both exist. They have never been run with a key, so the verifier's recall
  and false-positive rate are still unmeasured. Also test `--batch-size 5`
  against the default 20, to settle whether items late in a batch get less
  scrutiny.

- [ ] **2.3 The AI generation pilot, last.** Owner's sequencing: corpus path
  proven first, then generation for what the corpus cannot reach. On current
  evidence that is `futur_i`, `zustandspassiv_zeiten` and `futur_ii`, which
  are too rare even in 80,000 corpus sentences.

- [ ] **2.4 Decide the split and write it down.** After 2.1 and 2.3: which
  topics are corpus-sourced, which are generated, and the rule for choosing.
  That becomes the standing generation policy.

## 3. Owner changes that must never be overturned

Pinned by tests. Do not change without the owner saying so explicitly.

- `RPM_MAX_RETRIES = 5`, `FREE_LANE_MAX_CONCURRENCY = 4`,
  `FREE_LANE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE = 5` in `src/llm/client.py`.
- `SERVER_ERROR_BACKOFF_SECONDS = 15.0`, `SERVER_ERROR_MAX_RETRIES = 5` in
  `src/llm/client.py`. Applied by the owner after a pilot died on a 503.

Three separate cycles reverted an owner edit to this file. Both groups now
have a pinning test that says to ask rather than update the assertion.

---

## 4. Decisions the owner has made, so nobody relitigates them

- **Cue with the invariant citation form**, not a gender-agreed one. A cue
  equal to its answer is fine when the learner still had to work out case and
  gender. Verbatim: "cue being the answer is not a problem if the problem
  still requires student to identify case, declension etc."
- **Vocabulary is filtered at each topic's own CEFR level**, never one global
  ceiling. A B1 grammar topic is not restricted to A1 words.
- **Unresolved references are a property of the slot, not the sentence.**
  `Er sagte das damals nicht` is a good carrier; only a blank on `er` is bad.
- **Pilots forbid batch, not the paid lane.** Once free quota is spent they
  continue on paid, on demand.
